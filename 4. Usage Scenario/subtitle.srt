00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,833
Preparing visual assets for collage

2
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:05,733
is a tedious and time-consuming process.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,300
We introduce Collaposer, a tool that transforms photo collections

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,433
into visual assets for storytelling with collages.

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:19,300
Let's follow Lucas, a 2D motion designer,

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,366
as he creates a collage animation with the help of Collaposer.

7
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:26,433
Lucas begins with a folder of images

8
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:30,200
as he envisions a giant cat living in the countryside.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,800
He browses through the album and types a story description.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:41,133
A big cat is resting in a landscape under a blue sky with some clouds,

11
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,300
featuring a huge moon.

12
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:48,766
A man in white and red clothing is jumping on its back,

13
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:51,300
while a woman is lying there as well.

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,100
In the foreground, there are also some trees and plants.

15
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:02,966
It contains fixed elements directly related to the narrative,

16
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:05,966
while it also contains abstract words that

17
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:10,700
indirectly suggest additional visual elements related to the story.

18
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:14,966
In the backend, Collaposer extracts and clusters

19
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:18,966
visual elements from the photo collection based on the description.

20
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:20,533
After clustering,

21
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:23,833
character assets are segmented into body parts

22
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,933
with key points estimated for each section,

23
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:30,900
in preparation for articulated animation and deformation.

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,566
When the preparation of visual assets is completed,

25
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:38,000
the system interface transitions to the layer panel.

26
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:39,966
On the canvas view,

27
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,500
clustered elements are presented together.

28
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:46,633
The elements are resized based on selection criteria

29
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:50,433
to improve visibility and make them easier to select.

30
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:52,400
In the tree view

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,133
visual elements appear as leaf nodes

32
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:57,133
in a structured layer hierarchy,

33
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:59,400
providing an organized overview.

34
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:04,600
Lucas grasps an overview of the visual assets

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,300
and quickly identifies visual elements that catch his interest.

36
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,200
He interacts with both views to select desired elements

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,933
and arrange them into a static collage.

38
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:23,366
Lucas is satisfied with the scene and clicks export to obtain

39
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:25,166
two JSON files.

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,833
One that records the visual assets prepared by the system

41
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,433
and another that captures the final collage

42
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:33,233
information on the canvas,

43
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,933
along with a screenshot.

44
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:39,133
He runs an Extendscript script.

45
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:45,133
These files are read as clustered layers in Adobe After Effects.

46
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:50,500
Character layers are replaced by a set of body parts

47
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,933
with joint points serving as rotation centers.

48
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:58,200
Lucas adds a paper texture to the background

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,266
and adjusts the color

50
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:02,000
to match the desired tone of the composition.

51
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,800
He then animates the collages especially for characters,

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,800
as the separated body parts and body key points

53
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,000
allow for shape deformation and articulated animation.

54
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:19,100
Here are some animated collages

55
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,800
created with the output of Collaposer.
